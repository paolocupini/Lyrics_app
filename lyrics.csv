The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Astronomy Domine,"Lime and limpid green the second scene
the fights between the blue you once knew
floating down the sound resounds
around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon there on the run
Titanian, Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten



Winding signs flap

flicker flicker flicker flam pow pow

stairways scared and death rules there

blindman limpid green the sound

surrounds the icy waters under

lime and limpid green the sound

surrounds the icy waters underground"
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Lucifer Sam,"Lucifer Sam saw your cat
always sitting by your side
always by you side
that cat's something I can't explain
Jennifer Gentle you're the witch
you're the left side, he's the right side

oh no

that cat's something I can't explain

Wouldn't say we're going to see

me a hip cat, me a ship's cat

somewhere, anywhere

that cat's something I can't explain"
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Matilda Mother,"There was a king who ruled the land
His Majesty was in command
with silver eyes the scarlet eagle
showered silver on the people
Oh mother tell me more
Why'd you have to leave me there

hanging in my infant chair

waiting

You only have to read the lines

they're scribbled in black and everything shines

Across the stream with wooden shoes

bells to tell the king the news

a thousand misty riders climb up

higher once upon a time

Wandering and dreaming

the words had different meanings

yes they did

For all the time spent in that view

the doll's house darkness' old perfume

and fairy-stories held me high

on clouds of sunlight floating by

Oh mother tell me more

tell me more"
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Flaming,"Alone in the clouds all blue
lying on an eiderdown
yippie, you can't see me
but I can you
Lazing in the foggy dew
sitting on a unicorn

no fear, you can't hear me

but I can you

Watching buttercups cuff the light

sleeping on a dandelion

too much, I won't touch you

but then I might

Screaming through the scarlet sky

travelling by telephone

hey, ho here we go

ever so high"

The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,The Gnome,"I want to tell you a story
Bout' a little man
If I can
A gnome named Grimble Crumble
And little gnomes
Stay in their homes

Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine



He wore a scarlet tunic

A blue green hood

It looked quite good

He had a big adventure

Amidst the grass

Fresh air at last

Wining, dining, biding his time



And then one day

Hooray!

Another way for gnomes to say

Oooooooooomray



Look at the sky, look at the river

Isn't it good?

Look at the sky, look at the river

Isn't it good?



Winding, finding places to go.



And then one day - hooray!

Another way for gnomes to say

Hoooooooooray.

Hooooooooooooooray."
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Chapter 24,"A movement is accomplished in six stages
and the seventh brings return
the seven is the number of the young light
it forms when darkness isn't creased by one
Change returns succes
going and coming without error

action brings good fortune

sunset, sunrise

The time is with the month of winter solstice

when the change is due to gome

thunder in the early course of heaven

things cannot be destroyed once and all for all"
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,The Scarecrow,"The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
stood with a bird on his hat and swore
everywhere he didn't care
he stood in a field where barly grows
His head did no thinking, his arms didn't move
exept when the wind cut-a-pup and mice ran

around on the ground

he stood in a field where barley grows

The black and green scarecrow was sadder than me

but now he's resined to his fate 'cause life's not

unkind, he doesn't mind

he stood in a field where barley grows"
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Bike,"I've got a bike, you can ride if you like
it's got a basket, a bell that rings
and things to make it look good
I'd give it to you if I could
but I borrowed it
You're the kind of girl

that fits in with my world

I'll give you anything, everything

if you want thing

I've got a cloak, it's a bit of a joke

there's a tear up the front, it's red and black

I've had it for months

if you think it gould look good

then I guess it should

I know a mouse and he hasn't got a house

I don't know why I call him Gerald

He's getting rather old but he's a good mouse

I've got a clan of gingerbread men

here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men

take a couple if you wish, they're on the dish

I know a room of musical tune

some wine, some gin, most of them are clockwork

let's go into the other room and make them work"
A Saucerful of Secrets,Let There Be More Light,"Far far far away way
people heard him say say
I will find a way way
there will come a day day
something will be done

Then at last the mighty ship

descending at a point of flame

made contact with the human race at no time



Now now now is the time time

time to be be be aware



Not as far the solar bear

in human role revealed to him

a living soul of heavenward forever



Sunlight, something in my eye

something in the sky

waiting there for me



The antilope grows hurling back

the servicemen would like to sigh

the memory wentflowing rounds

as Lucy in the sky



Oh oh did you ever know

no never ever will they ascend



Summoning in his cosmic powers

and flowing slightly from his toes

psychedelic nations fly"
A Saucerful of Secrets,Remember a Day,"Remember a day before today
a day when you were young
renew a play along with time
evening with a thyme
Sing now a song that can't be sung

without a morning's kiss

dream you shall be it if you wish

look for your king

Why can't we play today

why can't we stay that way



Climb your fatal apple tree

try to catch the sun

hide from your little brother's gun

dream yourself away



Why can't we reach the sun

why can't we blow the years away

go away

remember remember"
A Saucerful of Secrets,Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,"Little by little the night turns around
counting the leaves wich tremble in the dawn
notices leaning on each other and yearning
under the leaves the swallow is resting
Set the controls for the heart of the sun



On to the mountain watching the Watcher

breaking the darkness, breaking the grapevine

the moment your flaw is run to your shadow

notice the shadow that reopens the vine

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

heart of the sun



Breaking the shape of his questions for ever

when the sun will fall in the evening

will he remember the lesson I gave him



Set the controls for the heart of the sun

heart of the sun"
A Saucerful of Secrets,Corporal Clegg,"Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war
In 1944
Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red, and blue
He found it in the zoo

Dear oh dear oh were they really sad for me?

Dear oh dear oh will they really laugh at me?



Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him

Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?



Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain

He's never been the same

No one is to blame

Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream

From Her Majesty the Queen

His boots were very clean



Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him

Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?"
A Saucerful of Secrets,See-Saw,"""Marigolds are very much in love
but he doesn't mind
pickin' up sister
he makes his way in to the see-saw land
all the way up she smiles
she goes up while he goes down



Sits on a stick in the river

laughter in his sleep

sister's throwing stones

hoping for a hit

he doesn't know, so then

she goes up while he goes down

Another time, another day

a brother's way to leave

another time, another day day day



She was selling plastic flowers

on a sunday afternoon

pickin' up weeds, she hasn't got time to care

all can see, he's not there

she grows up for another man and he's down



another time, another day

a brother's way to leave

another time, another day

A Saucerful of Secrets,Jugband Blues,"It's awfully considerate of you to think of me there
and I'm most obliged to you for making it clear
that I'm not there
and I never knew the room could be so big
and I never knew the room could be so blue
and I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes

and brought me here instead dressed in red



And I'm wandering who could be writing this song

I don't care if the sun don't shine

I don't care if nothing is mine

and I don't care I'm nervous with you

I'll do my loving in the winter

And the sea isn't green

and I love the queen

and what exactly is a dream

and what exactly is a joke"
Atom Heart Mother,Atom Heart Mother,"""Here is a loud announcement""
""Silence in the studio!""

Atom Heart Mother,If,"If I were a swan
I'd be gone
If I were a train
I'd be late
And if I were a good man
I'd talk with you more often than I do



If I were to sleep

I could dream

If I were afraid

I could hide

If I go insane

Please don't put your wires in my brain



If I were the moon

I'd be cool

If I were a rule

I would bend

If I were a good man

I'd understand the spaces between friends



If I were alone

I would cry

And if I were with you

I'd be home and dry

And if I go insane

Will you still let me join in with the game?



If I were a swan

I'd be gone

If I were a train

I'd be late again

If I were a good man

I'd talk with you more often than I do"
Atom Heart Mother,Summer '68,"Would you like to say something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We said goodbye before we said hello
I hardly even like you
I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago

The music was too loud

From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year

And I would like to know

How do you feel?

How do you feel?



Not a single word we said

Delights still without fears

Occasinally you showed a smile

But what was the need

I felt the cold far too soon

The wind of '95

My friends are lying in the sun

I wish that I was there

Tomorrow brings another town

Another girl like you

Have you time before you leave to greet another man?

Just you let me know

How do you feel?

How do you feel?



Goodbye to you

Charlotte Kringles too

I've had enough for one day"
Atom Heart Mother,Fat Old Sun,"When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evenin' birds are calling
Summer's thunder time of year
The sound of music in my ears
Distant bells
New mown grass smells so sweet

By the river holding hands

Roll me up and lay me down



And if you see

Don't make a sound

Pick your feet up off the ground

And if you hear as the warm night falls

The silver sound from a time so strange

Sing to me

Sing to me



When that fat old sun in the sky is falling

Summer evenin' birds are calling

Children's laughter in my ears

The last sunlight disappears

And if you see

Don't make a sound

Pick your feet up off the ground

And if you hear as the warm night falls

The silver sound from a time so strange

Sing to me

Sing to me

When that fat old sun in the sky is...(fades out)"
Atom Heart Mother,Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast,(Instrumental)
Meddle,One of These Days,"One of these days
I'm going to cut you into little pieces"
Meddle,A Pillow of Winds,"The cloud of eiderdown draws around me
softening the sound
sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side
and she's breathing low, and the candle dies
When night comes down you lock the door

the book falls to the floor

as darkness falls and waves roll by

the seasons changed, the wind is warm



Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan

behold the dream, the dream is gone

green fields, a cold rain

is falling in a golden dawn



and deep beneath the ground the early morning sounds

and I go down

sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side

and she's breathing low and I rise like a bird

in the haze when the first rays touch the sky

and the night winds die"
Meddle,Fearless,"You say the hill's too steep to climb, try it
you say you'd like to see me try, climb it
you pick the place and I'll choose the time
and I'll climb the hill in my own way
just wait a while for the right day
and as I rise above the tree-line and the clouds

I look down, hearing the sounds of the things you've said today



Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd, smiling

mercyless the magistrate turns round, frowning

and who's the fool who wears the crown

go down in your own way

and every day is the right day

and as you rise above the fear-lines in his crown

you look down, hearing the sound of the faces in the growd



You never walk alone, you never walk alone

walk on, walk on with hope in your heart

and you never walk alone, you never walk alone"
Meddle,San Tropez,"As I reach for a peach, slide a line down behind, a sofa in San Tropez
breaking a stick with a brick on the sand
riding a wave in the wake of an old sedan
sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness
scratched by the sand that fell from my love
keeping my dreams and I still hear her calling

if you're alone, I'll come home



Backward and homebound, a pigeon, a dove

gone with the wind, the rain on a airplane

owning a home with no silver spoon

I'm drinking champagne like a good tycoon

sooner than wiat for a break in the weather

I'll gather my far-glung thoughts together

speeding away on the wind to a new day

if you're alone, I'll come home



And I pause for a while by a country style

and listen to the things they say

digging the gold in a hole in my hand

hoping the good, take a look at the way things end

and you're leading me down to a place by the sea

I hear your soft voice calling to me

making a date for later by phone

And if you're alone, I'll come home



(Thanks to Marco for these corrections)"
Meddle,Seamus,"I was in the kitchen
Seamus, that's the dog, was outside
well I was in the kitchen
Seamus, my own hound, was outside
well you know the sun was sinking slowly
and my own hound-dog sat right down and cried"
Meddle,Echoes,"Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant tide
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine



And no-one showed us to the land

And no-one knows the where or whys

But something stirs and something tries

And starts to climb towards the light



Strangers passing in the street

By chance two separate glances meet

And I am you and what I see is me

And do I take you by the hand

And lead you through the land

And help me understand the best I can



And no-one calls us to move on

And no-one forces down our eyes

And no-one speaks and no-one tries

And no-one flies around the sun



Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes

Inviting and inciting me to rise

And through the window in the wall

Come streaming in on sunlight wings

A million bright ambassadors of morning



And no-one sings me lullabies

And no-one makes me close my eyes

And so I throw the windows wide

And call to you across the sky"
Obscured by Clouds,Burning Bridges,"Bridges burning glady, melting with the shadow
flickering between the lines
stolen mormons floating softly on the air
gone on wings of fire and climbing higher
Ancient bulbs are breaking, leaving all and changing sides

dreaming of a new day, cast aside the other way

magic vision, staring, kindled by the burning flames

lies in her eyes



The door it stands ajar

it was, it once was high beyond the guilded cage

beyond the reach of time, the moment is at hand

she breaks the golden band"
Obscured by Clouds,The Gold It's in the...,"Come on, my friends, let's make for the hills
they say there's gold and I'm looking for thrills
you can get your hands on whatever we find
' cause I've only come along for the ride
Well you go your way and I'll go mine

I don't care if we get there on time

everybody's searching for something, they say

I'll get my kicks on the way



Over the mountains, across the sea

who knows what may be waiting for me

I could sail forever to strange sounding names

faces of people and places don't change



All I have to do is just close my eyes

to see the seagulls wheeling in the far distants skies

all I wanna tell you, all I wanna say

is count me in on the journey, don't expect me to stay"
Obscured by Clouds,Mudmen,instrumental
Obscured by Clouds,Childhood's End,"You shout in your sleep
that's the price, it's just too steep
is your conscience at rest
it was put to the test
you awake with a start
just the beating of your heart

just one man beneath the sky

just two ears, just two eyes



You said, sail across the sea

long past thoughts and memories

childhood's end: your fantasies

merging harsh realities

and then as the sail is hoist

you'll find your eyes are growing moist

and all the fears never voiced

say you have to make the final choice



Who are you and who am I

to say we know the reason why

some are born, some men die

beneath one infinite sky

there'll be war and there'll be peace

but anything one day will cease

all the iron turn to rust

all the proud men turn to dust

so all things time will mend

so this song will end"
Obscured by Clouds,Free Four,"One two three four
The memories of a man in his old age
are the deeds of a man in his prime
you shuffle in the gloom of the sick room
and talk to yourself as you die



Life is a short warm moment

and death is a long cold rest

you get your change to try in the twinkling of an eye

eighty years with luck or even less



So all aboard for the American tour

and maybe you'll make it to the top

but mind how you go, and I can tell you ' cause I know

you may find it hard to get off



But you are the angel of death

and I am the dead man's son

he was buried like a mole in a fox-hole

and everyone's still on the run



And who is the master of foxhounds

and who says the hunt is begun

and who calls the tune in the court-room

and who beats the funeral drum"
Obscured by Clouds,Stay,"Stay and help me to end the day
and if you don't mind, we'll break a bottle of wine
stick around and maybe we'll get one down
' cause I want to find what lies behind those eyes
Midnight blue, burning gold

a yellow moon is growing cold

I rise, looking through my morning eyes

surprised to find you by my side

light my brain, don't try to remember your name

to find the words to tell you goodbye



Morning dews, newborn day

midnight blue turned to grey

midnight blue, burning gold

a yellow moon is growing cold"
Obscured by Clouds,Absolutely Curtains,Instrumentalstück
The Dark Side of the Moon,Speak to Me,"I've been mad for fucking years
Absolutely years, been over the edge for yonks
Been working me buns off for bands
I've always been mad, I know I've been mad
Like the most of us have
Very hard to explain why you're mad

Even if you're not mad"
The Dark Side of the Moon,Breathe (In the Air),"Breathe, breathe in the airdon't be afraid to careleave, but don't leave melook around, choose your own groundfor long you live and high you fly,smiles you'll give and tears you'll cryand all you touch and all you see,is all your life will ever beRun, rabbit run!Dig that hole,forget the sunand when at last the work is donedon't sit down it's time to dig another onefor long you live and high you flybut only if you ride the tideand balanced on the biggest waveyou race towards an early grave"
The Dark Side of the Moon,On the Run,"Baggage, your passports ready,
and follow the green line to customs and then to immigration
BA two-one-five to Rome, Prado, Naples

for BA two-one-five to Rome, Prado, Naples

Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me

Ha-ha-ha-a-a-a-a-a!"
The Dark Side of the Moon,Time,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way 
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain 

You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today 

And then one day you find ten years have got behind you 

No one told you when to run you missed the starting gun 



And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking 

Racing around to come up behind you again 

The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older 

Shorter of breath and one day closer to death



Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time 

Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines

Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way 

The time is gone the song is over thought I'd something more to say



Home home again

I like to be here when I can

And when I come home cold and tired

It's good to warm my bones beside the fire

Far away across the field

The tolling of the iron bell

Calls the faithfull to their knees

To hear the softly spoken magic spell"
The Dark Side of the Moon,The Great Gig in the Sky,"And I am not frightened of dying
Any time will do, I don't mind
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime
I never said I was frightened of dying



I never said I was afraid of dying"
The Dark Side of the Moon,Money,"Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're OK
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team



Money, get back

I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack

Money, it's a hit

Don't give me that do goody good bullshit

I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set

And I think I need a Lear jet





Money, it's a crime

Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie

Money, so they say

Is the root of all evil today

But if you ask for a rise

It's no surprise that they're giving none away





[Interview excerpts]

- Yeah (chuckles) I was in the right!

- Yes, absolutely in the right!

- I certainly was in the right!

- Yeah, I was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a bruising!

- Yeah!

- Why does anyone do anything?

- I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!

- I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in Number Two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out"
The Dark Side of the Moon,Us and Them,"Us and them 
And after all we're only ordinary men 
Me,and you

And the front rank died 

And the general sat,and the lines on the map 

Moved from side to side 

Black and blue 

And who knows which is which and who is who 

Up and down 

And in the end it's only round and round and round 

Haven't you heard it's a battle of words 

The poster bearer cried 

Listen son,said the man with the gun

there's room for you inside 



Down and out 

It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about 

With,without

And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about 

Out of the way, it's a busy day

For wants of the price of a tea and a slice

The Dark Side of the Moon,Brain Damage,"The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall

the lunatics are in my hall

the paper holds their folded faces to the floor

and every day the paper boy brings more



And if the dam breaks open many years too soon

and if there is no room upon the hill

and if your head explodes with dark forbodings too

I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

The lunatic is in my head

The lunatic is in my head

you raise the blade, you make the change

you rearrange me ' till I'm sane

you lock the door

and throw away the key

there's someone in my head but it's not me

I'll see you on the dark side of the moon"

Wish You Were Here,Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Pts. 1-5),"Remember when you were young, You shone like the sun. Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, Like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught on the crossfire Of childhood and stardom, Blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter, Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! You reached for the secret too soon, You cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, And exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome With random precision Rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions, Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!"
Wish You Were Here,Welcome to the Machine,"Welcome, my son, welcome to the machine.
Where have you been? It's alright, we know where you've been.
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time,
provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys'.
You bought a guitar to punish your ma,
and you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool,

so welcome to the machine.



Welcome, my son, welcome to the machine.

What did you dream? It's alright, we told you what to dream.

You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar,

he always ate in the Steak Bar, he loved to drive in his Jaguar.

So welcome to the machine."
Wish You Were Here,Have a Cigar,"Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar. You're gonna go far,
you're gonna fly high, you're never gonna die, you're gonna make it if you try;
they're gonna love you.
Well I've always had a deep respect, and I mean that most sincerely.
The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think.
Oh by the way, which one's Pink?

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy,

we call it Riding the Gravy Train.



We're just knocked out, we heard about the sell out.

You gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people.

We're so happy we can hardly count.

Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart?

It's a helluva start, it could be made into a monster

if we all pull together as a team.

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy,

we call it Riding the Gravy Train."
Wish You Were Here,Wish You Were Here,"So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell,
Blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? 
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

And did they get you trade your heroes for ghosts?

Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?

Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange

A walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?



How I wish, how I wish you were here.

We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,

Year after year,

Running over the same old ground. What have we found?

The same old fears,

Wish you were here."
Wish You Were Here,Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Pts. 6-9),"Remember when you were young, You shone like the sun. Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, Like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught on the crossfire Of childhood and stardom, Blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter, Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! You reached for the secret too soon, You cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, And exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome With random precision Rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions, Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!"
Animals,Dogs,"You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need.
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street,
you gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed.
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight,
you gotta strike when the moment is right, without thinking.

And after a while you can work on points for style,

like the club tie and the firm handshake,

a certain look in the eye and an easy smile.

You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,

so that when thy turn their backs on you,

you'll get the chance to put the knife in.



You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder.

You know it's going to get harder, and harder and harder as you get older.

And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south,

hide your head in the sand,

just another sad old man,

all alone and dying of cancer.



And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown.

And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone.

And it's too late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around.

So have a good drown as you go down, alone,

dragged down by the stone.



I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused.

Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used.

Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise.

If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my own way out of this maze?



Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending

that everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend.

And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner.

And everything's done under the sun,

and you believe a heart, everyone's a killer.



Who was born in a house full of pain,

who was trained not to spit in the fan,

who was told what to do by the man,

who was broken by trained personnel,

Who was fotted with collar and chain,

who was given a seat in the stand,

who was breaking away from the pack,

who was only a stranger at home,

who was ground down in the end,

who was found dead on the phone,

who was dragged down by the stone."
Animals,Pigs (Three Different Ones),"Big man, pig man, ha ha charade you are.
You well heeled big wheel, ha ha charade you are.
And when your hand is on your heart,
you're nearly a good laugh, almost a joker,
with your head down in the pig bin,
saying,  Keep on digging, pig stain on your fat chin.

What do you hope to find?

When you're down in the pig mine

You're nearly a laugh, you're nearly a laugh,

but you're really a cry.



Bus stop rat bag, ha ha charade you are.

You fucked up old hag, ha ha charade you are.

You radiate cold shafts of broken glass.

You're nearly a good laugh, 

almost worth a quick grin.

You like the feel of steel, 

you're hot stuff with a hat pin,

and good fun with a hand gun.

You're nearly a laugh, you're nearly a laugh,

but you're really a cry. 



Hey you, Whitehouse, 

ha ha charade you are.

You house proud town mouse, 

ha ha charade you are.

You're trying to keep our feelings off the street,

you're nearly a real treat, 

all tight lips and cold feet,

and do you feel abused?

You gotta stem the evil tide,

and keep it all on the inside.

Mary, you're nearly a treat, 

Mary, you're nearly a treat,

but you're really a cry."
Animals,Sheep,"Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away,
only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out, there may be dogs about.
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen things are not what they seem.
What do you get for pretending the dangers not real.

Meek and obedient you follow the leader

down well trodden corridors, into the valley of steel.

What a surprise! A look of terminal shock in your eyes.

Now things are really what they seem. No, this is no bad dream.



The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want He makes me down to lie.

Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by.

With bright knives He releaseth my soul.

He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places.

He converteth me to lamb cutlets.

For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger.

When cometh the day we lowly ones,

trough quiet reflection and great dedication,

master the art of karate,

lo, we shall rise up,

and then we'll make the buggers eyes water.



Bleating and babbling I fell on his neck with a sream.

Wave upon wave of demented avengers

march cheerfully out of obscurity unto the dream.



Have you heard the news? The dogs are dead!

You better stay home and do as you're told,

get out of the road if you want to grow old."

If you should go skating

On the thin ice of modern life

Dragging behind you the silent reproach

Of a million tear stained eyes

Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice

Appears under your feet

You slip out of your depth and out of your mind

With your fear flowing out behind you

As you claw the thin ice"
The Wall,The Happiest Days of Our Lives,"When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children any way they could
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness

However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known

When they got home at night, their fat and

Psycopathic wives would thrash them

Within inches of their lives"

You have grown colder and
Nothing is very much fun any more.



And I can feel one of my turns coming on.

I feel cold as razor blade 

Tight as a tourniquet 

Dry as a funeral drum,

Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left 

You'll find my favorite axe

Don't look so frightened

Just one of my bad days

How could you go?

When you know how I need you (need you, need you...)

To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

Don't give in whitant a fight

Hey you! Out there on your own

Sitting naked by the phone would you touch me

Hey you! With your ear against the wall

Waiting for someone to call out would you touch me

Hey you! Would you help me to carry the stone

Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy

The wall was too high as you can see

No matter how he tried he could not break free

And the worms ate into his brain.

Hey you! Out there of the road

Doing what you're told, can you help me

Hey you! Out there beyond the wall

Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me

Got those swollen hand blues.
Got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from



I've got electric light

And I've got second sight

I've got amazing powers of observation



And that is how I know 

When I try to get through 

On the telephone to you 

There'll be nobody home 



I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm

And I've got the inevitable pinhole burns

All down the front of my favorite satin shirt 



I've got nicotine stains on my fingers

I've got a silver spoon on a chain

I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains



I've got wild staring eyes

I've got a strong urge to fly 

But I've got nowhere to fly to

There's still nobody home

I've got a pair of Gohills boots

And I've got fading roots."

Just the basic facts

Can you show me where it hurts?



There is no pain, you are receding

A distant ship smoke on the horizon

You are only coming through in waves

Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever

My hands felt just like two balloons

Now I've got that feeling once again

I can't explain, you would not understand

This is not how I am 

I have become comfortably numb



O.K. 

Just a little pin prick

There'll be no more aaaaaaaah! 

But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?

I do believe it's working, good

That'll keep you going through the show 

Come on it's time to go.



There is no pain you are receding

I turned to look but it was gone

I cannot put my finger on it now

As the other ranks held back

The enemy tanks for a while

And the Anzio bridge head

Was held for the price

Of a few hundred ordinary lives

And old King George sent Mother

A note when he heard that father was gone

It was, I recall, in the form of

A scroll, with gold leaf and all

And I found it one day

In a drawer of old photographs hidden away

And my eyes still grow damp to remember

His Majesty signed

With his own rubber stamp

It was dark all round, there was frost on the ground

When the tigers broke free

And no one survived

and the silver in her hair shines in the cold november air

you hear the tolling bell

and touch the silk in your lapel

and as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band

you take her frail hand

and hold on to the dream



A place to stay

enough to eat

somwhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street

where you can speak out loud

about your doubts and fears

and what's more no-one ever disappears

you never hear their standard issue kicking in your door

you can relax on both sides of the tracks

and maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control

and everyone has recourse to the law

and no-one kills the children anymore

and no-one kills the children anymore

The Final Cut,Two Suns in the Sunset,"In my rear view mirror the sun is going down
sinking behind bridges in the road
and I think of all the good things
that we have left undone
and I suffer premonitions
confirm suspicions

of the holocaust to come



The rusty wire that holds the cork

that keeps the anger in

gives way

and suddenly it's day again

the sun is in the east

even though the day is done

two suns in the sunset

hmmmmmmmmm

could be the human race is run



like the moment when the brakes lock

and you slide towards the big truck

you stretch the frozen moments with your fear

and you'll never hear their voices

and you'll never see their faces

you have no recourse to the law anymore



and as the windshield melts

my tears evaporate

leaving only charcoal to defend

finally I understand

the feelings of the few

ashes and diamonds

foe and friend

we were all equal in the end"
A Momentary Lapse of Reason,Signs of Life,"Spoken:""When the child like view of the world went, nothing replaced it...nothing replaced it...nothing replaced it...I do not like being asked to.....i do not like being asked to... I do not like being asked to....Other people replaced itSomeone who knows""[Instrumental]"
A Momentary Lapse of Reason,Learning to Fly,"Into the distance, a ribbon of black,
stretched to the point of no turning back.
a flight of fancy on a wind swept field,
standing alone my sense reeled.
a fatal attraction, holding me fast, how
can I escape this irresistable grasp?



Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky,

tongue-tied twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

ice is forming on the tips of my wings

unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything

no navigator to guide my way home

unladened, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that's learning to fly

condition grounded but determined to try



Can't keep my eyes from the -circling- skies

tongue-tied twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

above the planet on a wing and a prayer

my grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air

across the clouds I see my shadow fly

out of the corner of my watering eye

a dream unthreatened by the morning light

could blow this soul right through the roof of the night



There's no sensation to compare with this

suspended animation, a state of bliss



Can't keep my mind from the circling sky

tongue-tied twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I"
A Momentary Lapse of Reason,The Dogs of War,"Dogs of war and men of hate
with no cause, we don't discriminate
discovery is to be disowned
our currency is flesh and bone
hell opened up and put on sale
gather round and haggle

for hard cash, we will lie and deceive

even our masters don't know the webs we heave



one world, it's a battleground

one world, and we will smash it down

one world...one world



Invisible transfers, long distance calls

hollow laughter in marble halls

steps have been taken, a silent uproar

has unleashed the dogs of war

you can't stop what has begun

signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion

we all have a dark side, to say the least

and dealing in death is the nature of the beast

one world, it's a battleground

one world, and we will smash it down

one world...one world



The dogs of war don't negotiate

the dogs of war won't capitulate

they will take and you will give

and you must die so that they may live

you can knock at any door

but wherever you go, you know they've been there before

well winners can lose and things can get strained

but whatever you change, you know the dogs remain



one world, it's a battleground

one world, and we will smash it down

one world...one world"
A Momentary Lapse of Reason,One Slip,"A restless eye across a weary room
a glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
the music played and played as we whirled without end
no hint, no word her honour to defend
I will, I will, she sighed to my request

and then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put

to the test

then drowned in desire, our souls on fire

I led the way to the funeral pyre

and without a thought of the consequence

I gave in to my decadence



one slip, and down the hole we fall

it seems to take no time at all

a momentary lapse of reason

that binds a life for life

a small regret, you won't forget

there'll be no sleep in here tonight



was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?

or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just

like a glove?

the moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown

the year grew late and neither one wanted to remain

alone



one slip, and down the hole we fall

it seems to take no time at all

a momentary lapse of reason

that binds a life to a life

the one regret, you will never forget

there'll be no sleep in here tonight

one slip...one slip..."
A Momentary Lapse of Reason,On the Turning Away,"On the turning away
from the pale and downtrodden
and the words they say
wich we won't understand
""Don't accept that what's happening
is just a case of others' suffering

or you'll find that you're joining in

the turning away""



It's a sin that somehow

light is changing to shadow

and casting its shroud

over all we have known

unaware how the ranks have grown

driven on by a heart of stone

we could find that we're all alone

in the dream of the proud



On the wings of the night

as the daytime is stirring

where the speechless unite

in a silent accord

using words you will find are strange

mesmerised as they light the flame

feel the new wind of change

on the wings of the night



No more turning away

from the weak and the weary

no more turning away

from the coldness inside

just a world that we all must share

it's not enough just to stand and stare

is it only a dream that there'll be

no more turning away"
A Momentary Lapse of Reason,Yet Another Movie,"One sound, one single sound
one kiss, one single kiss,
a face outside the window pane,
however did it come to this?
A man who ran: a child who cried

a girl who heard, a voice that lied

the sun that burned a fiery red

the vision of an empty bed



The use of forge, he was so tough

she'll soon submit, she's had enough

the march of fate, the broken will

someone is lying very still



He has laughed and he has cried

he has fought and he has died

he's just the same as all the rest,

he's not the worst, he's not the best



And still this ceaseless murmuring,

the babbling that I brook,

the seas of faces, eyes upraised

the empty screen, the vacant look



A man in black on a snow white horse,

a pointless life has run it's course,

the red rimmed eyes, the tears still run

as he fades into the setting sun"
A Momentary Lapse of Reason,Terminal Frost,instrumental
A Momentary Lapse of Reason,Sorrow,"The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
a man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
but awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise

in his youth or a dream, he can't be precise

he's chained forever to a world that's departed

It's not enough, It's not enough



His blood has frozen & curled with fright

his knees have trembled & given way in the night

his hand has weakened at the moment of truth

his step has faltered



One world, one soul

Time pass, the river roll



And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication

and silent replies that swirl invitation

flow dark and troubled to any oily sea

a grim intimation of what is to be

There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night

and there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight

and silence that speaks so much louder than words

of promises broken"
The Division Bell,Cluster One,(Instrumental)
The Division Bell,What Do You Want from Me,"As you look around this room tonight
Settle in your seat and dim the lights
Do you want my blood, do you want my tears
What do you want
What do you want from me
Should I sing until I can't sing any more

Play these strings until my fingers are raw

You're so hard to please

What do you want from me



Do you think that I know something you don't know

What do you want from me

If I don't promise you the answers would you go

What do you want from me

Should I stand out in the rain

Do you want me to take a daisy chain for you

I'm not the one you need



What do you want from me

You can have anything you want

You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water

Anything you want



You can own everything you see

Sell your soul for complete control

Is that really what you need



You can lose yourself this night

See inside there is nothing to hide

Turn and face the light

What do you want from me"
The Division Bell,Poles Apart,"Did you know?
It was all going to go so wrong for you?
And did you see
It was all going to be so right for me
Why did we tell you then?
You were always the golden boy then

And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes



Hey you did you ever realise what you'd become

And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from

Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway

Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes



(Did you know did you know?

Did you know did you know?

Did you know did you know?)



The rain fell slow down on all the roofs of uncertainty

I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me



And did you know

(Did you know did you know?

Did you know did you know?

Did you know did you know?

Did you know did you know?)



I never thought that you'd lose the light in your eyes



(Did you know did you know?

Did you know did you know?

Did you know did you know?)"
The Division Bell,Marooned,(Instrumental)
The Division Bell,A Great Day for Freedom,"On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down
The ship of fools had finally run aground

Promise up the night like paper doves in flight



I dreamed you had left my side

No warmth, not even pride remained

And even though you needed me

It was clear that I could not do a thing for you



Now life devalues day by day

As friends and neighbors turn away

And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone



Now frontiers shift like desert sands

While nations wash their bloodied hands

Of loyalty, of history in shades of grey



I woke to the sound of drums

The music played, the morning sun streamed in

I turned and I looked at you

And all but the bitter residue slipped away...slipped away"
The Division Bell,Wearing the Inside Out,"From morning to night I stayed out of sight
Ditn't recognise I'd become
No more than alive I'd barely survive
In a word...overrun
Won't hear a sound

From my mouth

I've spent too long

On the inside out

My skin is could

To the human touch

This bleeding heart's

Not beating much



I murmured a vow of silence and now

I don't even hear when I think aloud

Extinguished by light I turn on the night

Wear its darkness with an empty smile



I'm creeping back to life

my nervous system all awry

I'm wearing the inside out



Look at him now

He's paler somehow

But he's coming round

he's starting to choke

It's been so long since he spoke

Well he can have the words right from my mouth



And with these words I can see

Clear trough the clouds that covered me

Just give it time then speak my name

Now we can hear ourselves again



I'm holding out

For the day

When all the clouds

Have blown away

I'm with you now

Can speak your name

Now we can hear

Ourselves again"
The Division Bell,Take It Back,"Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze
I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness; the earth was on fire
She could take it back, she might take it back some day



So I spy on her, I lie to her, I make promises I cannot keep

Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep

And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take

And I push her to the limit to see if she will break



She might take it back, she could take it back some day



Now I heave seen the warnings, screaming from all sides

It's easy to ignore them and G-d knows I've tried

All of this temptation, you know it turned my faith to lies



Until I couldn't see the danger or hear the rising tide



She can take it back, she will take it back some day

She can take it back, she will take it back some day

She can take it back, she will take it back some day"
The Division Bell,Coming Back to Life,"Where were you when I was burned and broken
While the days slipped by from my window watching
Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
dying to believe in what you heard

I was staring straight into the shining sun



Lost in thought and lost in time

While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted

Outside the rain fell dark and slow

While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime



I took a heavenly ride through our silence

I knew the moment had arrived

For killing the past and coming back to life



I took a heavenly ride trough our silence

I knew the waiting had begun

And headed straight... into the shining sun"
The Division Bell,Keep Talking,"For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk
There's a silence surrounding me
I can't seem to think straight

I'll sit in the corner

No one can bother me

I think I should speak now

I can't seem to speak now

My words won't come out right

I feel like I'm drowning

I'm feeling weak now

But I can't show my weakness

I sometimes wonder

Where do we go from here



It doesn't have to be like this

All we need to do is make sure we keep talking



Why won't you talk to me

You never talk to me

What are you thinking

What are you feeling

Why won't you talk to me

You never talk to me

What are you thinking 

Where do we go from here



It doesn't have to be like this

All we need to do is make sure we keep talking



Why won't you talk to me

You never talk to me

What are you thinking

What are you feeling

Why won't you talk to me

You never talk to me

What are you thinking

What are you feeling



I feel like I'm drowning

You know I can't breathe now

We're going nowhere

We're going nowhere"
The Division Bell,Lost for Words,"I was spending my time in the doldrums
I was caught in a cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralysed
I thought that everything else would just wait
While you are wasting your time on your enemies

Engulfed in a fever of spite

Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades

Like shadows into the night



To martyr yourself to caution

Is not going to help at all

because ther'll be no safety in numbers

When the right one walks out of the door



Can you see your days blighted by darkness?

Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?

Stuck in a world of isolation

While the ivy grows over the door



So I open my door to my enemies

And I ask could we wipe the slate clean

But they tell me to please go fuck myself

You know you just can't win"
The Division Bell,High Hopes,"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps

Running before time took our dreams away

Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground

To a life consumed by slow decay



The grass was greener

The light was brighter

With friends surrounded

The nights of wonder



Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us

To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side

Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again

Dragged by the force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled

We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world



Encumbered forever by desire and ambition

There's a hunger still unsatisfied

Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon

Though down this road we've been so many times



The grass was greener

The light was brighter

The taste was sweeter

The nights of wonder

With friends surrounded

The dawn mist glowing

The water flowing

The endless river

For ever and ever



Is that Charlie? Hello Charlie!



Great..."
